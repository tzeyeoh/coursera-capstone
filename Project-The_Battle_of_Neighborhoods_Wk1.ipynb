    "Business Problem:\n",
    "Challenge description: As a parent, I've discovered that the is a huge shortage of daycare centers for working parents in the Seattle, WA market. If I were to take the problem into my own hands, I would like to know the optimum neighborhood location to open my own daycare to optimize for the demand for daycare in the city.\n",
    "\n",
    "Criteria:\n",
    "1. Placement of the daycare would be close to high concentration of apartment complexes and/or zoned suburban areas so that parents can drop off their children close to home.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Daycares should also be further away ideally from venues that are non-kid friendly, such as bars, nightclubs, dispensaries, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Method:\n",
    "1. Identify all distinct neighborhoods in the Seattle area\n",
    "2. Query Foursquare to find specific venues in the daycare criteria mentioned in Business Program.\n",
    "3. Match Seattle neighborhood data to fourquare data that is nearby.\n",
    "4. Rank neighborhoods against venue critera, showing most common to least common venue in Seattle\n",
    "3. Select Neighborhood(s) that are the best fit for setting up a new daycare.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intended Outcome:\n",
    "Based on analysis of the data, identify best neighborhood location to set up new daycare."
